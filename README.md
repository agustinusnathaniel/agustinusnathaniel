# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, how are you? 

I'm currently working as a Frontend Engineer. Most of the time I work with TypeScript and React.<br/>
I make fun projects in my free time and share it here.
Whether to explore more around React and its frameworks (Gatsby, Next.js), Ionic, or trying out Svelte and Vue.

I like exploring useful and fun tech products (surfing around ProductHunt), traveling, and doing some visual arts (graphic design, videography, photography).
