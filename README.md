# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, how are you? 

I'm currently working as a Frontend Engineer. Most of the time I work with TypeScript and React.<br/>
I make fun projects in my free time and share it here.

I like exploring useful and fun tech products (surfing around ProductHunt), traveling, and doing some visual arts (graphic design, videography, photography).
